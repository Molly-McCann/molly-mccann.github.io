              <h1>Barclays FA WSL 2019-20: Chelsea FCW Analysis</h1>
							<p><i>Calm Under Pressure: Analysis of Player Tendencies Under Opponent Pressure and its Relation to Goal Scoring</i></p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>The 2019-20 Women’s Super League season was atypical due to the COVID-19 pandemic cutting the season short, completing only 17 out of 22 match days. Although Chelsea FC Women had one less point (39) than Manchester City Women (40) in the league table at the time of season cancellation, Chelsea was crowned champions due to an FA board decision. It was decided that the outcome of the season would be decided under a points-per-game system. In other words, Chelsea’s title relied on their ability to win matches, as the league awards a team three points for a win and 1 point for a draw. Because of this, the following analysis will focus on Chelsea’s success in goal scoring when attacking and the tactical play when under opponent pressure.</p>
							<p>In order to further understand how Chelsea was able to achieve a large number of points in the table having played one fewer game than Manchester City, it is important to look into several key contributing factors. The analysis will first examine Chelsea's ability to maintain composure and execute plays under opponent pressure, specifically focusing on their tendencies to either pass or carry the ball in pressured situations. By categorizing players by position (defenders, midfielders, and forwards), the analysis will assess how each group contributes to ball progression and the creation of goal-scoring opportunities.The examination of Chelsea’s tactical approach aims to uncover the relationship between their play under pressure and goal-scoring success, ultimately providing insights into how Chelsea maintained such a dominant performance during the season.</p>
							<h2>Related Work</h2>
							<p>Player actions under pressure has been an area of interest in soccer since the introduction of analytics to the game. One study found in Football Observatory looked at the most instances of high-intensity pressure per match and compared the successful passes, dribbles, and their lengths. Unlike much of the previous work, the following analysis will create Gini inequality indices for position groups for passing and carrying the ball when under pressure and not under pressure. The Gini index is a measure of inequality within a distribution, derived from the Lorenz curve, often used in economics to understand and weigh wealth inequality. The index is on a scale of 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. Similar to the information found on the website, Medium, the different Gini values for each position group should be interpreted differently based on the needs and demands of each position. Additionally, this information will be combined with player specific Gini values, plots of passes into the box, and expected goals. Expected goals (xG) is one of the most popular metrics known among soccer fans and pundits that measures the quality of a shot by “calculating the likelihood that it will be scored by using information on similar shots in the past” (Whitmore). Expected goals is still a prevalent statistic in analysts’ repertoire and is commonly incorporated into player and team stat pages.</p>
							<h2>Methods</h2>
							<p>The data used in the following analysis was sourced from the free StatsBombR package. The original dataset contains all WSL games for the 2019-20 season; however, these data has been subset to only contain Chelsea FCW’s matches. Contained in the data is a record of each event (shot, pass, carry, dribble, etc) that takes place in a match. For each event there are ball location coordinates, time stamp, player acting in the event, player position, touch location (right foot, left foot, head, etc), event outcome, and several other key pieces of information.</p>
							<p>To begin the analysis, a series of exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations were made in order to gain a more complete understanding of the components included in the dataset. These EDA visualizations evaluated the general scope of Chelsea FCW’s attack and defense. On the defensive side, a mapping of passes and clearances out of the box by their right center back, Millie Bright, was plotted. From this mapping, it was seen that Millie Bright passed to her fullbacks or wingers on the right side of the field quite frequently. Her passes were also very routine and systematic, a trait of a dependable center back.</p>
							<p>Next, a mapping of passes into the attacking box by forward Sam Kerr was created. This visualization displayed the creative nature of Sam Kerr from her varied pass locations in the box, another trait that is consistent with solid attacking players. The final EDA visualization was a series of heatmaps of the defensive positioning for each team in the WSL (Figure 1). For top tier teams like Chelsea and Arsenal, their defensive half had less defensive actions than their attacking half. This indicates that these teams attempt to win the ball back on their opponents defensive half and are high pressure teams.</p>
