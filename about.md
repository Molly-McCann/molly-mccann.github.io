My name is Molly McCann, and I'm a recent sports analytics master’s graduate from the University of Notre Dame. I have a deep passion for soccer analytics and a love for exploring data in all its forms.

As a former NCAA Division III soccer player, I bring a unique perspective to my analyses by combining technical data skills with firsthand knowledge of the game. I'm particularly interested in exploring how data can optimize decision-making in scouting, strategy, and player development. 

When I’m not diving into soccer data or watching my favorite teams, I enjoy creating visualizations and analyzing data on topics I find fascinating, from film to music. I love uncovering stories in the numbers and sharing insights that resonate with others.
