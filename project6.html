              <h1>Pitch Sequencing & Effectiveness Using Markov Transition Logic on 2025 New York Yankees Pitchers</h1>

							<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
							<p>Pitch calling and sequencing has been an integral part of baseball strategy since the turn of the 20th century. As the process has evolved over time, the analytics and technology incorporated into sport has allowed for greater defensive strategy on the mound. The following analysis seeks to derive insights on pitching strategy by applying Markov chain modeling framework to better understand pitch type sequencing and its ability to deceive the batter. As analytics continues to influence how the game is approached, there is an increasing interest in quantifying how sequences, not just isolated pitches, affect batter behavior. The benefit of the Markov framework is that it mimics game flow and allows for pitch types to be modeled as a sequence of probabilistic transitions. The goal of this analysis is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather an introduction to considering pitch calling and sequencing as a decision making process that can be quantified and evaluated.</p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>A pitcher’s strategic approach is shaped by a combination of his pitch arsenal and the expectations associated with his role in the lineup. Starters, relievers, and closers face distinct constraints and situations that influence pitch calls and how they sequence pitches and approach individual hitters. To maintain clarity and avoid improper comparisons amongst different role specific objectives, this analysis is limited to three starting pitchers from the 2025 New York Yankees: Max Fried, Carlos Rodón, and Cam Schlittler. By narrowing the scope to pitchers of the same role, the sequencing trends are isolated and allow for a more consistent application of the Markov modeling framework.</p>
							<h2>Data Description</h2>
							<p>The pitch-level data used in the following analysis was compiled from the pybaseball package in python using statcast function. The three pitchers each had an individualized dataset compiled that contained each pitch they threw during the year of 2025 for the Yankees during both regular and postseason. The statcast data contains 118 different columns; however, for the sake of this analysis, each pitcher’s data was segmented to only contain relevant columns. The primary columns referenced outlined the pitch type, pitch name, at bat number, pitch number, and description of what occurred as a result of the at bat. A series of derived variables were then created to provide context to each pitch and categorize the effectiveness of each pitch.</p>
							<p>Defensively, the goal of the pitcher is to fool the batter into an out, whether a strikeout, groundout, or flyout. For simplicity, this analysis will focus on strikeouts as an “effective pitch.” In other words, a pitch will be considered “effective” if it results in a swinging strike, a swinging strike blocked, or a called strike. This derived variable definition removes most external factors that could confound the analysis on defensive strategy, including foul balls, individual fielder skill, and broader game context. </p>
							<p>Pitch sequencing is inherently conditional on historic context, meaning the next pitch thrown depends on what the pitcher just threw and what result it produced. Because the statcast data provides a new row for each pitch thrown, it is essential that a new column is added to signify the previous pitch type. This lagged feature comes with another important definition: what is a sequence. In this analysis, a sequence consists of two consecutive pitches, referred to as previous pitch and next pitch. This sequence resets for each new plate appearance. Thus, the first pitch to a new batter after an out, walk, or start of an inning will have a null value for the previous pitch.</p>
