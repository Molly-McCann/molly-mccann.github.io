              <h1>Pitch Sequencing & Effectiveness Using Markov Transition Logic on 2025 New York Yankees Pitchers</h1>

							<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
							<p>Pitch calling and sequencing has been an integral part of baseball strategy since the turn of the 20th century. As the process has evolved over time, the analytics and technology incorporated into sport has allowed for greater defensive strategy on the mound. The following analysis seeks to derive insights on pitching strategy by applying Markov chain modeling framework to better understand pitch type sequencing and its ability to deceive the batter. As analytics continues to influence how the game is approached, there is an increasing interest in quantifying how sequences, not just isolated pitches, affect batter behavior. The benefit of the Markov framework is that it mimics game flow and allows for pitch types to be modeled as a sequence of probabilistic transitions. The goal of this analysis is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather an introduction to considering pitch calling and sequencing as a decision making process that can be quantified and evaluated.</p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>A pitcher’s strategic approach is shaped by a combination of his pitch arsenal and the expectations associated with his role in the lineup. Starters, relievers, and closers face distinct constraints and situations that influence pitch calls and how they sequence pitches and approach individual hitters. To maintain clarity and avoid improper comparisons amongst different role specific objectives, this analysis is limited to three starting pitchers from the 2025 New York Yankees: Max Fried, Carlos Rodón, and Cam Schlittler. By narrowing the scope to pitchers of the same role, the sequencing trends are isolated and allow for a more consistent application of the Markov modeling framework.</p>
							<h2>Data Description</h2>
							<p>The pitch-level data used in the following analysis was compiled from the pybaseball package in python using statcast function. The three pitchers each had an individualized dataset compiled that contained each pitch they threw during the year of 2025 for the Yankees during both regular and postseason. The statcast data contains 118 different columns; however, for the sake of this analysis, each pitcher’s data was segmented to only contain relevant columns. The primary columns referenced outlined the pitch type, pitch name, at bat number, pitch number, and description of what occurred as a result of the at bat. A series of derived variables were then created to provide context to each pitch and categorize the effectiveness of each pitch.</p>
							<p>Defensively, the goal of the pitcher is to fool the batter into an out, whether a strikeout, groundout, or flyout. For simplicity, this analysis will focus on strikeouts as an “effective pitch.” In other words, a pitch will be considered “effective” if it results in a swinging strike, a swinging strike blocked, or a called strike. This derived variable definition removes most external factors that could confound the analysis on defensive strategy, including foul balls, individual fielder skill, and broader game context. </p>
							<p>Pitch sequencing is inherently conditional on historic context, meaning the next pitch thrown depends on what the pitcher just threw and what result it produced. Because the statcast data provides a new row for each pitch thrown, it is essential that a new column is added to signify the previous pitch type. This lagged feature comes with another important definition: what is a sequence. In this analysis, a sequence consists of two consecutive pitches, referred to as previous pitch and next pitch. This sequence resets for each new plate appearance. Thus, the first pitch to a new batter after an out, walk, or start of an inning will have a null value for the previous pitch.</p>
							<h2>Mathematical Foundation</h2>
							<p>A Markov chain is a mathematical model for a random process where the likelihood of a specific outcome occurring is dependent only on the current outcome, not the entire past history. This memoryless property is what allows for the Markov framework to be applied to this pitch sequencing problem, as it mimics the scenario between the pitcher and the batter. In other words, the batter places large emphasis on the most recent pitch thrown, but not the pitcher’s full past sequence of pitches thrown. Thus, the Markov chain is ideal for pitch sequencing because each pitch depends heavily on the previous one. The transition matrices used in a Markov process allow for the quantification of the dependencies from pitch to pitch and whether certain pitch sequences produce more effective outcomes for pitchers. This provides the framework for understanding strategic sequencing and deception on the mound. </p>
							<p>It is important to note that in this analysis, the transition matrix approach used is rooted in Markov principles and logic; however, it is not a full Markov chain model with states, long run behavior, or stationary distributions. The core theory of conditional transitions is being applied, while the full math that typically comes with using a Markov model is not applied.</p>
							<h2>Methods</h2>
							<p>Before diving deeper into the math used in this framework, some of the variables must be defined in mathematical terms. Given the definition of a pitch sequence outlined previously, the next pitch is referred to as <i>X<sub>t</sub></i> and the previous pitch thrown immediately prior is referred to as <i>X<sub>t-1</sub></i> in the mathematical definitions. Thus, each ordered pair (<i>X<sub>t-1</sub></i>, <i>X<sub>t</sub></i>) is a single pitch sequence. Additionally, let <i>i</i> denote the previous pitch type and <i>j</i> denote the next pitch type. Then, the number of observed transitions from pitch type <i>i</i> to pitch type <i>j</i> (defined as <i>N<sub>ij</sub></i>) is outlined in Definition 1.</p>

							<p></p>
							<p>Using these basic definitions, the transition probability matrix was created for each pitcher by normalizing the transition counts across rows as seen in Definition 2.</p>

							</figure>
							<p></p>
							<p>Here <i>P&#770;<sub>ij</sub></i> is the data based estimate of the chance that pitch type <i>j</i> follows pitch type <i>i</i>. The sum on the denominator represents the total number of times pitch <i>i</i> appeared as a previous pitch in the dataset. In other words, it is how many times the pitcher threw pitch <i>i</i> and then threw some pitch after it. In this case, <i>k</i> can be any possible next pitch. Each row in this transition matrix represents the empirical conditional probability distribution of the next pitch type given the current pitch type. This matrix serves as the baseline sequencing model.</p>
							<p>Then a second transition matrix was constructed using only pitches labeled as effective. The transition probabilities for this second matrix were computed using the same normalization procedure as above. This matrix is referred to as the effective sequencing matrix, <i>P&#770;<sup>(eff)</sup></i>. It represents the sequencing tendencies specifically associated with the pitches that were defined to have “effective” outcomes.</p>
							<p>After the creation of the two transition matrices, the difference of the two is calculated. This difference, outlined in Definition 3, answers whether the <i>i</i> to <i>j</i> transition is more likely to occur when the pitch is effective than it is overall. </p>

							<p></p>
							<p>If the difference is a positive value, this means that the pitch sequence produces effective outcomes more often than expected. If the difference is negative, the pitch sequence underperforms compared to what was expected. A near zero value means that the pitch sequence behaves as expected.</p>
							<p>Note that the methodology used in this calculation and comparison is computing not long run Markov behavior. The comparison only uses Markov framework and theory  to quantify pitch sequence effectiveness and does not contain the mathematics involved in a full Markov process or model.</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>For ease of interpretation, three visuals were created for each of the selected Yankees pitchers. The first distinct visual is a heatmap of the overall sequencing matrix, <i>P&#770;<sub>ij</sub></i>. Here dark blue represents a high probability of the sequence being thrown and light blue represents a rarely thrown sequence. The second visual for all three of the selected pitchers is the conditional effective sequencing matrix, <i>P&#770;<sup>(eff)</sup></i>.  The green represents an extremely effective pitch sequence, while red represents a pitch sequence that is poor in terms of being an effective pitch sequence. The third and final visual is a bar chart that is computing the expected effectiveness of a given sequence if the pitcher starts the sequence with each type of pitch.</p>
