							<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
							<p>An analytical approach to understanding the body’s performance during exercise has proven to be instrumental in optimizing training and recovery for athletes. Researchers at the University of Malaga have conducted Graded Exercise Tests (GETs) to gather insights into the cardio-respiratory performance of athletes from both amateur and professional backgrounds. These tests, conducted on treadmills, involved measuring key metrics such as oxygen consumption, ventilatory thresholds, and heart rate dynamics during the progression to maximal effort and subsequent recovery. While endurance and aerobic efficiency are often derived from these measures, the need for a comprehensive performance score has become increasingly important as athletes analyze their past performances and future outcomes. The following research seeks to develop a performance rating system based on these graded exercise test results, normalizing scores by age, sex, and weight, and applying clustering techniques to categorize athletes into performance tiers. Additionally, it will look into whether there are key determinants of a faster recovery after achieving maximal effort. Lastly, an analysis will be done with the results of athletes with multiple tests.</p>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>The initial steps of creating performance scores for GETs include selecting key physiological variables that best represent an athlete’s aerobic capacity and endurance. The data provided contains a basic number of cardio-respiratory measures; however, a series of derived variables will be beneficial to the analysis. As mentioned, the base values alone do not account for natural physiological variations due to age, gender, and weight, necessitating the normalization of these factors to ensure fair comparisons across diverse athlete populations included in the GET research. Additionally, applying clustering techniques, such as k-means, allows for the categorization of athletes into performance tiers, offering a structured framework to assess differences between amateur and professional athletes.</p>
							<p>Beyond performance evaluation, understanding recovery dynamics after reaching maximal effort is essential for optimizing training regimens and minimizing fatigue-related risks. Recovery is often measured using trends in heart rate reduction and ventilation after exertion. In athletics, recovery can be used as a reflection of overall fitness and health. Through regression models, it is possible to quantify recovery patterns and compare them across different athlete groups. This can help to identify what factors are key determinants of faster recovery and provide insight into the factors that contribute to an athlete’s ability to return to baseline after maximal exertion.</p>
							<p>By integrating these findings, this research seeks to bridge the gap between raw physiological data and practical applications, offering a framework for evaluating both performance and recovery in athletes from a wide range of ages and sporting backgrounds.</p>
							<h2>Related Work</h2>
							<p>Graded exercise tests (GETs) and performance tiers are well-established concepts in research on athlete performance. Previous studies have explored various applications of GET results to optimize both performance and recovery. A Journal of Sports Medicine study, “Graded Exercise Testing Protocols for the Determination of VO2 max: Historical Perspectives, Progress, and Future Considerations,” examines the relationship between GETs and physiological performance. The article highlights the impact of exercise on the “integrated cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychological systems” (Beltz et al.). Its primary focus is determining the optimal maximum oxygen consumption during exercise. While the following research takes a slightly different approach to analyzing GET results, it builds upon the fundamental concept of assessing oxygen consumption during and after exercise.</p>
							<p>Performance tiers have historically been used by coaches and trainers to compare results from one athlete to another. It can also be used to implement fitness development plans. An article published by International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance, “Defining Training and Performance Caliber: A Participant Classification Framework”, discusses both the benefits and negatives of classifications for athletes. It stresses the importance of taking into account a variety of factors, and wanted to expand the framework of athlete classifications by tailoring results to “different sports, athletes, and/or events” (McKay et. al). Although the article looks into the depth of sport participation as well as nationality differences, the performance tiers created using data collected by researchers at the University of Malaga will be more generalized due to lack of record for these attributes.</p>
							<h2>Data Description</h2>
							<p>The GET result data used in the following analysis was collected in the Exercise Physiology and Human Performance Lab of the University of Malaga from 2008 to 2018. To obtain the data on the participants, a PowerJog J series treadmill was connected to a CPX MedGraphics gas analyzer system to collect breath-by-breath measurements while the participant wore a Mortara 12-lead ECG device for cardiovascular related metrics. There are three periods within the test: warmup, effort, and recovery. During the warmup and recovery periods participants walk at a treadmill speed of 5 km/h. For the effort stage of the test, participants were asked to go beyond exhaustion, with a cutoff time when the oxygen consumption was saturated (meaning that one cannot take in any more oxygen).</p>
							<p>The metrics that are recorded during the test are: heart rate (HR), oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production (VCO2), respiration rate (RR), and pulmonary ventilation (VE). These, in addition to the treadmill speed, time since measurement starts, participant ID, and effort test ID were provided in the <i>test_measure.csv</i>. There are a total of 575087 lines present in the file. It is important to note that 30 results are missing measures for VO2, VCO2, and VE. The units of measurement for the variables are outlined in Figure 1.</p>

							<p>Demographic information on each participant ID corresponding to the test results is provided in the <i>subject-info.csv</i>. There are a total of 857 unique amateur and professional athletes who make up the test participants; however, the data does not specify participants’ athletic level to preserve anonymity. Included in the <i>subject-info.csv</i> are the following measures: effort test ID, participant ID, age, weight, height, room humidity, room temperature, and gender. The participants range from age 10 to 63 years old.</p>
							<p>Before beginning analysis, the original structure of the data must be altered as preparation. The <i>subject-info.csv</i> contains 992 rows; however, there are only 857 unique participants. This means some of the participants have multiple GETs recorded in the dataset. The athletes who participated in multiple tests thus have multiple entries in this csv, which are differentiated by the ID_test variable. Taking into account the complexities of the future clustering analysis, a new subset of both csv files provided was created such that each participant only has a singular test result stored. For the participants with multiple GET results, the most recent test (determined by participant age) was kept in the data subset. This new dataset will be referred to as <i>single_subject_info.csv</i> in this paper.</p>
							<p>Additionally, a subset of the data was created that includes only the athletes who have taken multiple GETs and their corresponding results. This dataset adds another component to the analysis, allowing for the study of these participants’ metrics over time. This subsetted data will be referred to as <i>multiple_test_measure.csv</i> in this paper. For this dataset, the creation of derived variables included maximum heart rate for each participant, maximum oxygen consumption, and maximum effort time. The maximum effort time for each test was created by the warmup end time from the recovery start time. In other words, it is the period in which the athlete puts in the most work.</p>
							<p>Derived variables for each athlete, stored in <i>single_subject_info.csv</i>, were created using data from <i>test_measure.csv</i> and <i>subject-info.csv</i>. The first of these variables generated aimed to provide insight into the timing of when each period of the test begins and ends. This included warmup start and end time, effort start and end time, and recovery start and end time. Next, the average HR and RR during each of these time periods was calculated. Additional performance metrics such as maximum treadmill speed, speed to HR ratio, and VO2 to speed ratio were also created as derived variables for future analysis. To assess cardiovascular response in participants, peak HR, treadmill speed when peak HR is achieved, percent of time spent at peak HR, and HR variability were also computed. Ventilatory efficiency and respiratory exchange ratio variables were made to look into metabolic efficiency performance among the athletes. Finally, to analyze the recovery and fatigue of athletes the initial HR recorded (as a baseline HR), last HR recorded, HR recovery rate, and recovery HR drop percentage. Outlined in Figure 2 are the calculations for some of the generated features explained above.</p>

							<h2>Methods</h2>
							<p>Before beginning the k-means clustering process, an additional data cleaning step was performed on the <i>single_subject_info.csv</i> and <i>test_measure.csv</i>. The 30 tests that do not contain records for VO2, VCO2, and VE (previously mentioned in the data description section) were removed from the datasets such that 846 rows resulted in the <i>single_subject_info.csv</i>. Before normalizing the variables, the columns containing the humidity information and temperature of the testing room were removed from the dataset.</p>
							<p>Using z-score scaling, the numeric columns were normalized and a new dataset called <i>scaled_subject_info.csv</i> was created to store these scaled variables. The parameters that the k-means algorithm requires are then set for an initial cluster analysis. The x parameter is the data that will be contained in the clustering. Centers is the number of clusters the algorithm will generate. Itermax is the number of iterations to let k-means perform. Nstart is the number of starts to try for k-means. This is because k-means may not converge to the optimal solution from a single start point, thus multiple start points are tried.</p>
